I put  tasks 1-5 into separate files for better clarity (at least for me)
I used views of source tables as basis for SQL codes and not a single united table, because I had issues with creating it at first
then I figured it out, problem with Union was in data types, but all tasks are already done so I will not change it as was suggested by the lecturet
instead I just fixed that in the source data table creation.
